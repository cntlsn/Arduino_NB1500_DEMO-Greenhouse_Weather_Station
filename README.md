# Greenhouse Weather Station with Arduino NB1500

This project is a weather station for a Greenhouse, based on the Arduino NB1500 board. It sends Temperature and Humidity data from a DHT sensor, and Light data from a LDR to a mobile web page (https://cntlsn.github.io/Arduino_NB1500_DEMO-Greenhouse_Weather_Station/).
